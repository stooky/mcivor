Shipping containers are quickly growing in popularity due to their versatility and relative affordability. Purchasing a pre-owned container can be a cost-effective and practical choice for various storage needs, and can form a base for a renovated tiny home, cabin, tool shed, and more. However, it's very important to understand a few things before making a purchase, so that you don't end up with any unwelcome surprises.

Here's what you need to know before buying a used shipping container:

## 1. Structural Integrity Inspection

When examining a used shipping container, thoroughly inspect the structure for signs of rust, dents, or bent frames. These issues could compromise the container's structural integrity, potentially leading to weaknesses or vulnerabilities that might impact its durability and long-term usability.

**What to look for:**
- Check corner posts for damage or bending
- Examine floor beams for rust or corrosion
- Look for any warping in the walls or roof
- Test the structural rigidity by checking for flex

## 2. Water Damage Assessment

A critical aspect of a container inspection involves checking for signs of water damage, particularly rust or corrosion. Such damage can indicate past or ongoing water ingress, potentially leading to mold growth, compromised structural integrity, and a reduction in the container's weatherproofing abilities.

**Signs of water damage:**
- Rust stains on floors or walls
- Musty odour inside the container
- Water marks or mineral deposits
- Bubbling or flaking paint

## 3. Door Functionality Evaluation

The functionality of container doors is paramount. Ensure they open and close smoothly without misalignment or significant resistance. Faulty or rusty door mechanisms can impede accessibility, making loading and unloading challenging, and may compromise the container's security and protection against external elements.

**Door checklist:**
- Open and close both doors completely
- Check that locking bars engage properly
- Examine hinges for rust or damage
- Verify doors seal tightly when closed

## 4. Quality of Seals and Locks

Pay close attention to the condition of the container's seals and locks. Damaged or worn-out seals can permit water ingress and compromise the container's weather resistance. Additionally, faulty or inadequate locks can pose security risks, potentially leading to unauthorized access or theft.

**Seal inspection points:**
- Door gaskets should be pliable, not cracked
- Check for gaps when doors are closed
- Test lock mechanisms for smooth operation
- Verify locking rod handles work correctly

## 5. Wear and Tear Examination

Examine the container for signs of excessive wear and tear or substantial damage. Identifying wear on the flooring, walls, or ceiling is crucial, as extensive wear might impact the container's reliability and structural integrity.

**Common wear areas:**
- Floor near the doors (highest traffic area)
- Lower sections of walls (forklift damage)
- Roof panels (impact damage from loading)
- Door thresholds (foot traffic wear)

## 6. Environmental Suitability Assessment

Consider the container's past environmental exposure and its potential impact on its condition. Exposure to extreme weather conditions might result in accelerated deterioration or corrosion. Ensuring the container is suitable for your intended use, taking into account the environmental factors it has encountered, is crucial.

**Questions to ask:**
- Where was the container previously used?
- Was it stored near salt water?
- Has it been exposed to extreme temperatures?
- What cargo did it previously carry?

## 7. Reputable Supplier Selection

Choosing a reputable supplier is a fundamental step in minimizing potential risks associated with used container purchases. A trusted supplier follows rigorous inspection standards, ensuring that containers meet high-quality benchmarks.

**Benefits of a reputable dealer:**
- Honest condition assessments
- Transparent pricing
- Delivery expertise
- After-sale support
