Used shipping containers are one of the smartest storage investments you can make. They're durable, secure, weatherproof, and surprisingly affordable. If you're considering buying a used container in Canada, here's everything you need to know.

## Why Buy Used?

New shipping containers (often called "one-trip" containers) command premium prices. Used containers offer significant savings while still providing excellent functionality:

### Cost Savings
Used containers typically cost 30-50% less than new ones. For most storage applications, this represents outstanding value—you're getting the same steel construction and weatherproofing at a fraction of the price.

### Environmental Benefits
Buying used is inherently sustainable. You're extending the life of an existing container rather than creating demand for new manufacturing. Given that a container can last 25+ years with proper care, buying used makes environmental sense.

### Proven Durability
A used container has already proven itself. It's survived ocean voyages, temperature extremes, and heavy use. If it's still in good condition, you know it's built to last.

### Immediate Availability
New containers often need to be ordered and shipped from overseas. Used containers are typically available locally and can be delivered within days.

## Understanding Container Conditions

When shopping for used containers in Canada, you'll encounter several condition grades:

### Cargo Worthy (CW)
These containers meet international shipping standards. They've been inspected and certified for ocean transport. For storage purposes, they're more than adequate—you're getting a container that's good enough for global shipping.

**What to expect**: Solid structure, functional doors, weatherproof seals. May have surface rust, minor dents, or cosmetic wear.

### Wind and Water Tight (WWT)
These containers are no longer certified for shipping but remain fully weatherproof. They'll protect your contents from rain, snow, and wind—exactly what you need for storage.

**What to expect**: More cosmetic wear than CW containers. May have repaired areas, faded paint, or minor floor wear. Still structurally sound and weather-sealed.

### As-Is Containers
These are sold without guarantees about condition. They may have holes, damaged doors, or other issues. However, they can be excellent values if you're handy with repairs or need covered storage where weather-sealing isn't critical.

**What to expect**: Visible damage, potential repairs needed. Inspect carefully before purchasing. Best for budget-conscious buyers who can handle minor repairs.

## What to Look For When Buying

### Structural Integrity
The container's frame is its backbone. Look for:
- Corner posts that are straight and undamaged
- Floor beams that aren't bent or rusted through
- Roof panels without significant dents or damage
- Side walls that are straight (not bowed)

### Door Function
The doors are the most-used part of any container. Check that:
- Both doors open and close smoothly
- Locking bars engage properly
- Rubber seals are intact (no gaps or tears)
- Hinges are solid (not rusted through)

### Floor Condition
Container floors are typically marine-grade plywood. Examine for:
- Rot or soft spots (press firmly with your foot)
- Water damage or staining
- Chemical residue from previous cargo
- Structural supports beneath the floor

### Weatherproofing
The whole point of a container is keeping contents dry. Check:
- Inside on a sunny day—look for light coming through
- After rain—look for water spots or staining
- Seals around doors and roof
- Any patches or repairs (they should be watertight)

## Pricing Factors in Canada

Container prices vary based on several factors:

### Location
Containers are more expensive the further you are from major ports. In Saskatchewan, prices reflect the transportation costs from Vancouver or Montreal.

### Condition
Better condition means higher prices. You'll pay more for CW than WWT, and more for newer containers with less wear.

### Size
40ft containers cost more than 20ft, but not twice as much. If you need the space, 40ft containers offer better value per square foot.

### Market Conditions
Container prices fluctuate with global shipping demand. Prices spiked during supply chain disruptions and have since moderated.

### Time of Year
Demand is higher in spring and summer when construction and moving seasons peak. Off-season purchases may offer better deals.

## Delivery Considerations

### Site Access
Delivery trucks need room to maneuver. Typical requirements:
- At least 100ft of straight approach
- No low-hanging wires or branches
- Firm ground (trucks are heavy!)
- Clear path to placement location

### Ground Preparation
Containers should sit on:
- Gravel pads
- Concrete blocks at corners
- Railroad ties
- Poured concrete slabs

Avoid placing directly on grass or soil—moisture can cause floor rot and containers may settle unevenly.

### Placement
Get it right the first time. Moving a placed container requires another delivery—plan your placement carefully considering:
- Access to doors
- Future expansion needs
- Sun exposure (if storing temperature-sensitive items)
- Snow accumulation (keep away from roof drip lines)

## Common Uses for Used Containers

Canadians use shipping containers for countless purposes:

### Personal Storage
- Seasonal equipment (ATVs, snowmobiles, boats)
- Household overflow
- Moving and renovation staging
- Workshop and tool storage

### Agricultural
- Equipment storage
- Grain and feed storage
- Chemical storage (with proper preparation)
- Workshop and repair facilities

### Business
- Inventory storage
- Document archives
- Equipment and tool storage
- Pop-up retail and events

### Construction
- On-site storage and security
- Mobile offices
- Material staging
- Tool cribs

## Bottom Line

Used shipping containers are a smart investment—especially when you know what to look for. Whether you're storing equipment, setting up a mobile office, or building something creative, a quality container can serve you well for decades.

The key is buying from a reputable dealer who provides honest condition assessments and stands behind what they sell.
