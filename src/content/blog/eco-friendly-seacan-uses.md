Summer construction season in Saskatchewan is the perfect time to think about sustainable solutions for your project needs. Shipping containers, also known as sea cans, offer an eco-friendly alternative to traditional construction site setups. Here's how you can use them to reduce your environmental impact while keeping your project running smoothly.

## On-Site Storage That Reduces Waste

One of the most practical uses for a sea can during construction is secure on-site storage. Instead of making multiple trips to off-site facilities or using disposable storage solutions, a shipping container provides:

- **Weatherproof protection** for materials and equipment
- **Reduced transportation emissions** by keeping everything on-site
- **Reusable storage** that can be moved to your next project
- **Theft prevention** with heavy-duty steel construction

By storing materials properly in a sea can, you also reduce waste from weather damage and theft—common problems on open construction sites.

## Mobile Offices and Break Rooms

Rather than constructing temporary buildings that will be demolished after your project, consider converting a shipping container into a mobile office or break room. These can be:

- Insulated for Saskatchewan's extreme temperatures
- Equipped with electrical connections
- Fitted with windows and doors
- Moved to your next site when the project is complete

This approach eliminates the waste associated with temporary structures and gives you a permanent asset that serves multiple projects.

## Material Staging and Organization

Keeping your construction site organized reduces errors, prevents material waste, and improves efficiency. Sea cans make excellent staging areas because:

- They provide clear, dedicated spaces for different materials
- Contents stay dry and protected
- You can set up shelving and organization systems inside
- Workers can quickly locate what they need

A well-organized site means fewer mistakes, less waste, and faster project completion.

## Tool and Equipment Security

Power tools and construction equipment represent a significant investment. A shipping container provides:

- **Lockable security** that deters theft
- **Protection from the elements** extending equipment life
- **Central location** for daily tool distribution
- **Reduced replacement costs** from damage or theft

When you're not replacing stolen or damaged equipment, you're not contributing to manufacturing demand—another way sea cans support sustainability.

## Choosing the Right Container

For most construction projects, you have several options:

### 20ft Standard Container
Ideal for smaller sites or when you need targeted storage. Easy to position in tight spaces and still offers substantial capacity.

### 40ft Standard Container
The workhorse of construction storage. Provides ample room for materials, equipment, and can even be partitioned for multiple uses.

### 40ft High Cube
Extra height (9'6" instead of 8'6") makes these perfect for storing taller equipment or setting up as a workshop or office space.

## Rental vs. Purchase

For one-time projects, renting makes environmental sense—the container gets reused by many customers over its lifespan. For contractors who regularly take on construction work, purchasing a container means:

- One container serving dozens of projects
- No transportation back and forth between rentals
- Long-term cost savings
- An asset that holds value
